# The UX of VR

A curated list of resources to help you on your journey into the User Experience of Virtual Reality

The contents of this list have now moved to http://uxofvr.com

Many thanks to all of the authors of the talks, articles, and guides referenced in the list. Without these people doing the hard thinking, Virtual Reality wouldn't be where it is today.

If you would like to suggest a resource, you can do so by creating an issue.
